========

C++ and SFML project I'm currently working on. 2D metroidvania engine.

So far I have:
- Texture manager
- (Basic) Entity classes
- Input module

Current output: single state with background and player (movable by mouse)

Things to working on:
- basic player control and movement
- entity generation (probably requires development of a state
  manager)
- sprite animation module
